<h1><b>Gulp package for Meteor</b></h1>
<i>Scaffolding and setup for gulp integration</li>

<h3>Setup</h3>
```bash
>> meteor add bbmoz:gulp
```
When you run "meteor", the necessary gulp NPM packages will be installed. In addition, two scaffold files will be created for you in the .gulp/ directory. These are:
- .gulp/gulpfile.js
- .gulp/package.json

<h3>Running gulp</h3>
In your .gulp/ directory, simply run "gulp". Please refer to the official gulp page at https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp.
