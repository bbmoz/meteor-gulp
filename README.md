<h1><b>Gulp package for Meteor</b></h1>
<i>Scaffolding and setup for gulp integration</li>

<h3>Installation</h3>
```bash
>> meteor add bbmoz:gulp
>> npm install -g gulp
>> meteor
```

<h3>Running gulp</h3>
After you run "meteor", there should be a new .gulp/ directory with the following two files:
- .gulp/gulpfile.js
- .gulp/package.json
In your .gulp/ directory, simply run "gulp". By default, the jshint gulp plugin is installed and set up for you. Please refer to the official gulp page at https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp to create your own tasks.
